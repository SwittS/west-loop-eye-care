    <h3>about us:</h3>
    <p class="flow-text">Located a few short blocks from Chicago's dynamic downtown, West Loop Eye Care brings together a group of experienced doctors and staff, designer frames, superior contact lens fitting and its own lens lab to provide a level of service that you not only expect, but deserve.</p>
    <p class="flow-text">Our aim is to provide you and your family not only with a pair of glasses or contacts that fit and provide excellent vision, they will fit your personality as well. Admit it, feeling good is a large part of looking good, and we are committed to making you feel good about your eye care experience. We welcome patients of all ages. If it's your child's first pair of glasses or contacts, we are glad to help. We understand that this can be a major experience for both parents and children.</p>
    <p class="flow-text">Poke around the site for as long as you want. Get to meet our doctors, take a good long look at our glasses frames and the many vendors who bring them to us. Check on your insurance. We work with most of the major carriers. If we have something new happening, like a trunk show, look for it in the news section.</p>
    <p class="flow-text">Making an appointment is a simple telephone call or, if you like, use your computer or mobile device to make an appointment over the net. Nothing to it! We have a multi-lingual staff that can also help you in Spanish and Polish.</p>
    <p class="flow-text">We would love to help you see and look better while doing it!</p>
